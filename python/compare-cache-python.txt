The problem here is that the frequent code changes (happening in the src folder) invalidate the cached layer for line #3. 
Thus, the layers built for lines 3-5 must be rebuilt on each code change, and the pip install command is rather slow. 
You can improve this example as follows:

FROM python:3.11
WORKDIR /app
COPY ./src/requirements.txt .
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
COPY src src
CMD ["python", "my_app.py"]
